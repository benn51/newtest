        that records any issues encountered by an aircraft and the maintenance actions taken.
        The app makes this data readily available so that when another plane in the fleet\n 
        encounters the same issue, all the necessary records are accessible to quickly resolve the problem," 
        the app gives an option to search the records based on aircraft tail number, fault title, part number`,
